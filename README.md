For this project I created an actor that utilized reinforcement learning to learn how to play through a maze to get to a treasure. The actor correctly learned how to navigate the maze flawlessly and reached the treasure in the most optimal path. It did this through a combination of nerual networks and a reward based learning policy.

This course helped me connect to the larger field of computer science by reinforcing what computer scientists do and why it matters. Computer scientist design, analyze, and optimize algorithms and software systems to solve real-world problems. It can span many different systems from developing AI systems to optimizing machines that create parts. 

Approaching problems as a computer scientist requires a fine-tuned framework where it is important to define the problem clearly, break it into manageable parts, implement tests, and optimize solutions. This project helped me in refining my skills in problem solving, as I dove into a new topic that I had never explored before.

This project also highlighted how important ethical responsibilities are to both the end user and the organization. It is imperative to ensure privacy, security, accessibility, and fairness to the end user. Biases should be eliminated as they can be harmful. It is also important to be as transparent as possible about how the technology works and how it uses the user's data. To the organization, solutions that are reliable, efficient, and maintainable should be created. These solutions must align with the company goals.
